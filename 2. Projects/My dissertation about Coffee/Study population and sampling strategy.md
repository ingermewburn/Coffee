The target population for this survey encompasses a diverse group of individuals associated with university campuses, including undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, and administrative staff. This population is chosen due to its wide range of coffee consumption habits and its accessibility within the context of the research environment. University campuses serve as a microcosm of broader societal coffee consumption patterns, offering a unique opportunity to explore varied perspectives on coffee satisfaction within a relatively contained and accessible community.

To ensure a comprehensive understanding of the coffee experience across different campus demographics, a stratified sampling strategy will be employed. This approach allows for the inclusion of all major campus groups, ensuring that the sample is representative of the campus population's diversity in terms of age, academic discipline, and role within the university (e.g., student vs. staff). Within each stratum, participants will be selected randomly to minimize selection bias and to ensure that the findings can be generalized to the broader campus population.

The survey will aim to capture a wide array of experiences with campus coffee offerings, including but not limited to, the quality of coffee, the ambiance of campus coffee shops, the efficiency of service, and the role of coffee in facilitating campus social life and academic productivity. By focusing on this population and employing a stratified random sampling strategy, the research aims to gather rich, nuanced insights into the multifaceted role of coffee in the university setting, contributing to a more detailed and representative understanding of coffee satisfaction.

To recruit participants, we will utilize campus-wide emails, social media platforms associated with the university, and posters in high-traffic areas, ensuring that the survey reaches a broad audience across the campus community. In recognition of their time and contribution, participants will be offered a chance to enter a draw for coffee-related prizes, incentivizing participation while also adhering to ethical standards of voluntary participation.

In addition to the survey, we plan to conduct follow-up interviews with approximately 30 participants to delve deeper into the nuances of the coffee experience on university campuses. This qualitative phase aims to supplement and enrich the survey findings by providing detailed insights into individual perceptions, behaviors, and attitudes towards coffee consumption within the university environment.

The population for these interviews will be selected from respondents of the initial survey who indicate their willingness to participate in further research. To ensure a diverse and comprehensive exploration of experiences, participants for the interviews will be chosen based on a purposive sampling strategy. This approach allows us to select individuals representing a broad spectrum of coffee experiences and viewpoints, including variations in consumption habits, preferences, and the social and academic contexts of their coffee-related activities.

Special attention will be paid to ensuring that the interview sample reflects the diversity of the university's population, including a mix of genders, academic disciplines, and roles (students, faculty, and staff). Selection will also consider frequency of coffee consumption and locations on campus where coffee is purchased or consumed, aiming to capture a wide range of experiences and perspectives on the coffee culture within the university setting.

These interviews will provide an in-depth understanding of the personal and social dimensions of coffee satisfaction, offering rich, qualitative data that complements the broader trends identified through the survey. By employing a purposive sampling strategy for this phase of the research, we aim to ensure that the follow-up interviews not only deepen our understanding of the survey results but also explore the complex, lived experiences of individuals within the campus coffee culture.
