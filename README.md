This is an Obsidian vault created by Professor Inger Mewburn of The Australian National University. It's an obviously fictious research project about coffee. 

I have used GenAI to make all the text, so please don't take anything written in here seriously. I have tags to show whether I used #ChattieG or #Claude Opus.

I've included a bunch of tags to demonstrate how to use Graph View to find related notes:
 
#ethics 
#template 
#permanentnote 
#blogpost 

**To make full use of the vault you will need to install the following plug ins:**

**Data View** - This post on [Obsidian Rocks](https://obsidian.rocks/dataview-in-obsidian-a-beginners-guide/) has some installation tips.

This plug in is very powerful - I've done a simple example of using it to dynamically make a list from a specific tag: #WIP .

This is a relatively easy plug in to install. Go to the bottom left corner of your Obsidian window and you will see the gear hub icon, which is the settings menu.

Go down to 'community plug ins' from the list on the left. Type 'data view' into the search box, [see this screen shot](obsidian://open?vault=Coffee&file=5.%20Images%2FCommunity%20plug%20in%20page.png) for what it looks like.

In this vault, Dataview has been set up to show every note with a #WIP tag. Go to Inbox>[What's my work in Progress (WIP)?](obsidian://open?vault=Coffee&file=1.%20Inbox%2FWhat's%20my%20Work%20in%20Progress%20(WIP)%3F)

Add #WIP to any of the pages to see this page automatically update. 

**Zotero Integration** ([Github link here](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration))

Go to Community Plug ins and search for Zotero Integration. Install the plug in and turn it on.

In the settings of the Zotero Interaction plug-in, you will need to point Zotero at the template file I've provided, which you will find in the vault under Zotero>Zotero template 1 [see this screen shot](obsidian://open?vault=Coffee&file=5.%20Images%2FWhere%20to%20find%20the%20Zotero%20plug%20in.png)

To point the Zotero Integration plug in at the right file - [see this screen shot](obsidian://open?vault=Coffee&file=5.%20Images%2FWhere%20to%20find%20the%20Zotero%20plug%20in.png) 

[This post on Medium](https://medium.com/@alexandraphelan/an-updated-academic-workflow-zotero-obsidian-cffef080addd) has some installation tips.

**Teaching demonstration:**

If you want to teach Obsidian with this vault, here are my notes for a 1.5 hour walk through:

Explain what people are looking at - quick tour of the interface.
- File structure down the side
- Main window + adding a new tab + splitting the screen
- Right window + tags + toggling off and on (top right hand icon)

Explain the file structure that sits under the Vault by looking at it with the Finder instead of Obsidian. Explain Markdown as simply a text file, which can be read by most programs. This means that your notes are always there, even if Obsidian stops being available tomorrow.

Create a new Folder (this one will be called '6. The Pool Room')
- Right window + tags + toggling off and on (top right hand icon)
- Put an image in this folder using Finder
- Put a PDF (of one of my papers) in the vault using Finder

Create a new note in a folder
- Write a new blog post about coffee using Claude (crowdsource the ideas about coffee in the chat while you demo how to set up Claude for this task)
- Create a new note. Link it to the inbox using #WIP tag
  
Show local area network visualisation, show how to see related things with Tags.

Talk about backlinks, demonstrate how to make a back link
- With the double square brackets method and search
- By copying the internal Obdisian link and using the single square bracket

Show how to install the Zotero Integration plug in.
- Demonstrate taking notes with Zotero and importing them into Obsidian.

Demonstrate the use of the dataview plug in to make the inbox more useful as a jumping off point.
