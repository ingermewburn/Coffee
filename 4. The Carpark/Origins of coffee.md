The origin of coffee houses dates back to the 15th century in the Arabian Peninsula, within the Sufi shrines of Yemen. It was here that coffee beans were first roasted and brewed in a manner similar to how it is prepared today. The concept of a dedicated space for drinking coffee quickly spread. By the 16th century, coffee houses had become established in the Middle East and North Africa, serving as vibrant social hubs. These establishments, often referred to as "qahveh khaneh" in Persian, played a significant role in the cultural and social life of cities. They were places where people of different social standings could gather to discuss literature, politics, and the news of the day, fostering a culture of dialogue and exchange. The popularity of coffee houses soon spread to Europe, particularly in Italy, England, France, and Austria, becoming centers of intellectual exchange and networking, effectively shaping the social fabric of their respective societies. These early coffee houses are often credited with contributing to the development of the Enlightenment by providing a forum for free exchange of ideas.
