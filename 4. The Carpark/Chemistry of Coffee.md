Coffee is a complex beverage, comprising over a thousand chemical compounds that contribute to its flavor, aroma, and physiological effects. The primary component of coffee is water, but it is the myriad of dissolved solids that gives coffee its distinctive character. Caffeine is perhaps the most well-known compound, valued for its stimulating effects on the central nervous system. Other significant components include chlorogenic acids, which are potent antioxidants, and contribute to the bitterness and astringency of the brew. Lipids in coffee, such as cafestol and kahweol, found mainly in unfiltered coffee, can influence its mouthfeel and health properties. Volatile compounds, including aldehydes, ketones, and pyrazines, are responsible for coffee's aroma and flavor profile. Sugars and polysaccharides contribute to the body and sweetness, while melanoidins, produced during the Maillard reaction of roasting, give coffee its rich color and contribute to its overall flavor. Each of these compounds interacts in a delicate balance, affected by factors such as the coffee variety, soil chemistry, climate, processing methods, and brewing technique, culminating in the cup of coffee enjoyed worldwide.
